Follow the steps for downloading and runnnig the code:

1)Before running the python3 file, make sure all the libraries are installed.
  - tensorflow 
  - matplotlib.image (matplotlib)
  - keras_preprocessing(comes with tensorflow installation)
  - numpy 
  - cv2
  - imutils
  

2)Download detector.py in your computer directory, and copy the path of directory.

3) Open detector.py and replace only “/home/rahul/Desktop/Final” which are at four places with
     copied directory path.
     So the new path will become “your path/pic” at all four place.

3)Download “rps.h5” which is neural network trained model in the same directory.
4)Download "haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml"file in the same directory.
4)Now run python file with command python3 detector.py
